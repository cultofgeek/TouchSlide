TouchSlide
==========

A very old piece of code to mimic the touch interface of an iPhone using Flash.  The inteface is a basic slideshow that a user can drag and fling to move between the photos.  It's meant to mimic a user flinging photos using a touch device.

This was written in Flash AS2.  That's right. This piece of code is that old.  

This was written mostly as a quick proof-of-concept. You will need Flash to do anything with this file.  

I'm storing it here mostly for posterity more than anything else.
